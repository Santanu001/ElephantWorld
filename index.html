                <p>Elephants are the largest land mammals on earth and have distinctly massive bodies, large ears, and long
                trunks. They use their trunks to pick up objects, trumpet warnings, greet other elephants, or suck up
                water for drinking or bathing, among other uses. Both male and female African elephants grow tusks and
                each individual can either be left- or right-tusked, and the one they use more is usually smaller
                because of wear and tear. Elephant tusks serve many purposes. These extended teeth can be used to
                protect the elephant's trunk, lift and move objects, gather food, and strip bark from trees. They can
                also be used for defense. During times of drought, elephants even use their tusks to dig holes to find
                water underground. wo genetically different African species exist: the savanna elephant and the forest
                elephant, with a number of characteristics that differentiate them both. The African savanna elephant is
                the largest elephant species, while the Asian forest elephant and the African forest elephant are of a
                comparable, smaller size.</p>
                <p> Asian elephants differ in several ways from their African relatives, with more than 10 distinct physical
                differences between them. For example, Asian elephants' ears are smaller compared to the large
                fan-shaped ears of the African species. Only some male Asian elephants have tusks, while both male and
                female African elephants grow tusks.</p>
            <p>Led by a matriarch, elephants are organized into complex social structures of females and calves, while
                male elephants tend to live in isolation or in small bachelor groups. A single calf is born to a female
                once every four to five years and after a gestation period of 22 monthsâ€”the longest of any mammal.
                Calves are cared for by the entire herd of related females. Female calves may stay with their maternal
                herd for the rest of their lives, while males leave the herd as they reach puberty. Forest elephants'
                social groups differ slightly and may be comprised of only an adult female and her offspring. However,
                they may congregate in larger groups in forest clearings where resources are more abundant.</p>
